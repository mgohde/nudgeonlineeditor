What is the Nudge web editor project? 
=====================================

The Nudge Web Editor is a project designed to integrate an online storyline editor into
the Nudge project. This is a beneficial development for the following reasons:
    
    1. The existing standalone Java editor requires a user to have Java installed.
    2. The existing editor requires specific knowledge of the Nudge database to work.
    3. The editor's online collaboration toolset still requires an active login framework.
    4. It would be useful to make storylines accessible from anywhere.
    
How will the API be structured?
===============================

The API will be modeled following a modified RESTful framework. It will be comprised of 

    1. session -- Handles user session creation/deletion.
    2. story -- Used to set/retrieve story node information.
    3. account -- Creates/deletes user accounts.

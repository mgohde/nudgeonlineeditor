user API description
=====================

This API exists to allow users to be associated with unique session identifiers.
These session identifiers are, in turn, used to access, update, and modify storylines
on the server.

Each function is to be encoded in the following format:
    /functionname/arguments

when called remotely.

Arguments should be separated by semicolons.

login
=====
Creates a user session given the credentials provided.

Arguments: User ID, password.
Assumptions: That some form of encryptino is used so that passwords are not sent in plain text over a network.
             The password could be passed through some fairly simple cypher first to visually obfuscate it.
         
Returns:
    On success:
        A json message containing a session id hash and other relevant information.
        
    On failure:
        A(n?) HTTP error message.
        
logout
======

Arguments: User session hash
Assumptions: That it is safe to delete any given session regardless of its creator.

    On success:
        A json message containing the session id deleted.
    
    On failure:
        An HTTP error message.
